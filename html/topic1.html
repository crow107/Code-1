    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to
        write Web Pages.
         Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked
        together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.
         As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to
        simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure
        it to display.
        Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like
        headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information
        between researchers.
        Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available
        in HTML language.
        Basic HTML Document
        In its simplest form, following is an example of an HTML document:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> <a href="ex.html" target="hi">Example</a></li>
    </ol>
</body>
</html>
