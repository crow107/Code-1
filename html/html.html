    <P  >HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to
        write Web Pages.
         Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked
        together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.
         As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to
        simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure
        it to display.
        Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like
        headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information
        between researchers.
        Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available
        in HTML language.
        Basic HTML Document
        In its simplest form, following is an example of an HTML document:
        <pre>
    &lt; html &gt;
    &lt; head &gt;
    &lt; title &gt; This is document title &lt;/title &gt;
    &lt; /head &gt;
    &lt; body &gt;
    &lt; h1 &gt; This is a heading &lt; /h1 &gt;
    &lt; p &gt;Document content goes here..... &lt; /p &gt;
    &lt; /body &gt;
    &lt; /html &gt;
</pre>Either you can use Try it option available at the top right corner of the code box to check the
        result of this HTML code, or let's save it in an HTML file test.htm using your favorite text
        editor. Finally open it using a web browser like Internet Explorer or Google Chrome, or Firefox
        etc. It must show the following output</P>
<pre>HTML Tags
As told earlier, HTML is a markup language and makes use of various tags to format the
content. These tags are enclosed within angle braces &lt;Tag Name&gt;. Except few tags, most
of the tags have their corresponding closing tags. For example, &lt;html&gt; has its closing
tag&lt;/html&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tag has its closing tag &lt;/body&gt; tag etc.
Above example of HTML document uses the following tags:
</pre>
</body>
</html>
